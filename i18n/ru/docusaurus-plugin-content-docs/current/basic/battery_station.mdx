:::important Zeitgeist Battery Station is a test network in beta phase. You can follow this guide to connect to it but some things might not work yet. If you would like to report a bug please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Also note that the chain is liable to be reset **at any time without any warning.** :::

If you want to support and strengthen Battery Station by running your own network node, head over to the section [Get Connected](battery-station#get-connected). If you want to interact with Battery Station, head over to the section [Accessing the User Interface](battery-station#accessing-the-user-interface)

## Get connected

The minimum system requirements are:

- CPU: AMD EPYC 7601 (or another CPU with equivalent single core performance)
- RAM: 8 GB
- Hard drive: SSD

There are two ways that you can run a node and connect to the Battery Station testnet. One way is to [build the code from source](battery-station#building-from-source). On recent hardware this should take about 15 minutes. [The other way](battery-station#using-docker) is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) which doesn't need to build and can get you started right away.

### Building from source

_Note for Windows users: Although it should be possible to build this project_ _on Windows, it is not well supported. Instead it is recommended to build this_ _project inside WSL in Windows. If you want to build this on Windows anyways,_ _you can follow [this tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/windows-users)_ _to setup your build environment and continue with this tutorial afterwards._ _We have not tested building on Windows and cannot guarantee that it will work._

_Note for Ubuntu >= 16 users: Building from source is not necessary, since we offer_ _a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist/releases/download/v0.3.0/zeitgeist_parachain)._ _You can use it instead of building from source and skip this tutorial to the part_ _that describes how to fetch the Zeitgeist relay chain specification. Feel free to_ _use the following command to download the binary under the name "zeitgeist" into_ _the current folder (and don't forget to replace "/target/release/zeitgeist" with_ _"zeitgeist" during the tutorial):_

```bash
curl -o zeitgeist https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist/releases/download/v0.3.0/zeitgeist_parachain
chmod +x zeitgeist
```

The source code is hosted in the [zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist](https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist) repository on GitHub.

To be able to compile the project, Rust must be installed on your system. We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/#) to manage your rust build environments. This instructions will assume that you have rustup installed.

You will need to clone the code locally, and make sure that you have the [dependencies](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#1-build-dependencies) installed. Execute the following commands to fetch the project:

```bash
# clone the code locally and checkout latest version
git clone https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist.git --depth 1 --branch latest
# change directory
cd zeitgeist
```

Next configure rustup, on Unix you can execute the following script:

```bash
# use the initializer script
./scripts/init.sh
```

After initializing you can then start building by using the cargo command:

```bash
cargo build --release --features parachain --bin zeitgeist
```

_Note: A system with at least 16GB of RAM is required to build the node._

Once the build has finished you will have the _zeitgeist_ binary available in the _target/release_ folder.

You can start a full-node (non-authoring) for Battery Station from the root of the directory like this:

```bash
./target/release/zeitgeist --chain=battery_station --pruning=archive
```

You should see your node begin to sync blocks.

Feel free to play around with the other available options, which you can inspect by executing:

```bash
./target/release/zeitgeist --help
```

If you plan to continuously run your node, jump to the next section.

#### Automatically running the Zeitgeist parachain as a systemd service (Linux)

To automatically start and restart the zeitgeist chain, you can use a systemd service. It is not recommended to do this with a docker image.

We will create a non-privileged user to execute the Zeitgeist node, setup the folder structure, create a systemd service file, launch the service and inspect the output.

Create a new user (without a home folder) and disable login for that user:

```bash
sudo useradd -M -r -s /sbin/nologin zeitgeist
```

Create a folder that will contain the Zeitgeist data and the previously compiled binary file. Note where your _zeitgeist_ binary lies (by default it is within the source folder at _target/release_) and replace the path after the `cp` command that is shown below. In this example we will use _/services/zeitgeist_ as the base folder for our service, _/services/zeitgeist/bin_ will contain the _zeitgeist_ binary and the whole _/services/zeitgeist_ folder structure will be owned by the unprivileged zeitgeist user we created during the previous step:

```bash {2}
sudo mkdir -p /services/zeitgeist/bin
sudo cp /path/to/your/target/release/zeitgeist /services/zeitgeist/bin
sudo chown -R zeitgeist:zeitgeist /services/zeitgeist
sudo chmod -R go=-rwx /services/zeitgeist
```

Create a systemd service file. You can use your favorite editor, in this example we will use `nano` though, because it is well supported.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zeitgeist-node.service
```

You can just use the following template or adjust it to your needs:

_Note: The arguments after the double dash (--) apply to the relay chain, which is required by the parachain_

```bash {12,14,16,17-19,25-27}
[Unit]
Description=Zeitgeist Battery Station parachain full node
After=network.target
Requires=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple

    --port=30334 \
    --rpc-port=9934 \
    --ws-port=9945


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `zeitgeist-support-$RANDOM` with the name your node should have. Set `--port`, `--rpc-port` and `--ws-port` to some ports that are not occupied yet. Ensure that incoming traffic on those ports is allowed. The node will listen to RPCs over HTTP and WS, to make the node eligible for potential load-balancing. You can adjust the _Nice_ value to configure the priority of the process the service spawns. 20 is the lowest, -20 the highest priority.

Paste your copy buffer into nano by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+V` and save the changes by pressing `CTRL+X`, `y` and `ENTER`

Enable the service and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable zeitgeist-node
sudo systemctl start zeitgeist-node
```

Check if it is up and running and syncing with the rest of the network:

```bash
systemctl status zeitgeist-node
```

If it shows _Active: active (running)_, your service works as expected. Use the following command to retrieve your node id (from _Zeitgeist Parachain_):

```bash
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node.service | grep "node id"
```

Otherwise enter the following command and inspect what went wrong:

```
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node
```

If you are stuck with an error you can ask for assistance in our [node-operators Discord channel](https://discord.gg/WD3VkGt9eY).

We recommend [backing up the node secret file](battery-station#backing-up-the-node-secret-file-from-a-systemd-service), which is used to derive your node's id. The id might be required in future programs. If you want to restore a previous node id, jump to the [node id restoration section](battery-station#restoring-the-node-id-within-systemd).

### Using Docker

We publish the latest version to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node-parachain) that can be pulled and ran locally to connect to the Battery Station network. In order to do this first make sure that you have Docker installed locally.

#### Downloading the docker image

```bash
docker pull zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node-parachain:latest
```

#### Running a Zeitgeist parachain full node within docker

You can run the docker image using the following command, but the node id and the chain data are lost after you shut down the docker container.

```

</TabItem>

To keep the chain data, you will have to select a folder on your system that docker will use to store its files in. Ensure that the folder does exist and that you have write permission for that folder. Assuming the path you want to use locally is _/services/zeitgeist_ (and that docker has write permissions in this folder), the previous command should be appended by one more `-v` option:

That's it, your node should be running and syncing with other nodes, while using a persistent chain storage and node id. If you plan to continuously run your node, jump to the next section.

#### Running a Zeitgeist parachain full node in a persistent docker container

To automatically start a docker container at any occasion (including after reboots and errors), except when it was explicitly stopped by a docker command, append the `-d` and `--restart` flag to the `docker run` command from above. The following command includes those options. In addition to that, the node parameters are extended in a way that makes the node listen to RPCs over HTTP and WS, to make the node eligible for potential future load-balancing. Ensure that you adjust `-v /services/zeitgeist` to use a folder you desire for chain data and that docker has write permissions for it. Replace `zeitgeist-support-$RANDOM` with the name your node should have.

After the command was executed, one line is printed in the terminal that represents the container id. It has this format:

> 1e501c25e43be3f2cecc3bade11b22f60f17839d41b37cdac9139cb8ebc8700b

To retrieve your node id, execute the following command (replace _container_id_ with the container id that was printed to your terminal):

```bash
docker logs container_id
```

The previous command shows the outputs of the node. It should include one line containing your node id, that looks like:

> Local node identity is: 12D3KooWKzzeu1thnWQv8CCWaugFfpeCXnq7jmp6GENSdXqG5xX9

You can also retrieve the container id by using the following command:

```bash
docker ps --filter ancestor=zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node-parachain:latest
```

We recommend [backing up the node secret file](battery-station#backing-up-the-node-secret-file-from-a-docker-container), which is used to derive your node's id. The id might be required in future programs. If you want to restore a previous node id, jump to the [node id restoration section](battery-station#restoring-the-node-id-within-a-docker-container).

### Ensuring that you can restore your node's id

For anybody who has entered a node id in any of our forms, it is essential that you backup the corresponding node secret after you have set up the node to ensure, that you always can restore the node id that you have entered and consequently are always able to continue gathering rewards based on that node id.

Your node's id is derived from a secret seed. If you lose access to the data of your node, it is impossible to restore your node id, unless you have created a backup as long as you had access to the data.

#### Backing up the node secret file from a docker container

The following sections will explain how to retrieve the path to the node secret on Unix and Windows based systems. After retrieving the path, copy the file located at the path to a safe location that is not on the same machine where you copied the file from.

##### On Unix

```bash
echo "$(CONTAINER_ROW=`docker ps | grep zeitgeistpm/zeitgeist-node-parachain` && docker inspect --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{println .Destination}}{{end}}' ${CONTAINER_ROW%% *} | sed -n '2p')/chains/battery_station/network/secret_ed25519"
```

##### On Windows

First get the container id:

```bash
docker ps | findstr "zeitgeist"
```

The container ID is the leftmost number in the row. Then get the volume it's mounted to (replace _container_id_ with the id you extracted during the previous step):

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{println .Destination}}{{end}}' container_id
```

Last, append the following string to the last path in the output: _\chains\battery_station\network\secret_ed25519_ The resulting string is the location of the secret file.

#### Backing up the node secret file from a systemd service

The following command will print the location of your node's secret file (you might have to replace _zeitgeist-node_ with the name of your Zeitgeist node service):

```bash
SECRET_LOCATION=`journalctl -u zeitgeist-node | grep "Database: RocksDb at"` && echo ${SECRET_LOCATION##* RocksDb at } | sed 's/\/db/\/network\/secret_ed25519/'
```

Copy the file to a safe location that is not on the same machine you copied the file from.

#### Restoring the node id

Before the node is started, the node secret file backup has to be put in the data folder of the Zeitgeist node. The steps to restore the node id differ a bit between docker and systemd and are described in the following sections.

##### Restoring the node id within a docker container

First copy the node secret backup file _secret_ed25519_ into the docker folder that was mounted using the _-v_ command. If that folder does not exist yet, create it and ensure docker has the permissions to read from and write into it.

After that, append the following option to the `docker run` command right after the docker image (zeitgeist-node-parachain-TAG):

```bash
--node-key-file /zeitgeist/data/secret_ed25519
```

Don't forget to replace _/services/zeitgeist/_ with the directory you copied the backup into. Running the docker container will log the node id. Use it to verify that the Zeitgeist node does indeed use your old node's id.

```bash
docker logs container_id
```

##### Restoring the node id within systemd

First copy the node secret backup file _secret_ed25519_ into the data folder of your Zeitgeist node. You can use the following command to retrieve the data folder (replace _zeitgeist-node.service_ with the name of your Zeitgeist systemd file):

```bash
cat /etc/systemd/system/zeitgeist-node.service | grep -- "-d \|-d=\|--base-path"
```

After copying the node secret file backup to this location, append the following line to the line starting with _ExecStart_ within your Zeitgeist systemd file (replace _/services/zeitgeist_ with the data folder, in which you placed your backup): `--node-key-file /services/zeitgeist/secret_ed25519`

Stop any running node, update the daemon and start the node again (replace _zeitgeist-node_):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop zeitgeist-node; sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start zeitgeist-node
```

Finally, verify that the Zeitgeist node does indeed use your old node's id (replace _zeitgeist-node_):

```bash
journalctl -u zeitgeist-node.service | grep "node id"
```

### Connecting to Telemetry

By default, your node will connect to Parity's telemetry endpoint that is accessible at [https://telemetry.polkadot.io](https://telemetry.polkadot.io). You can ensure your node is up and running by visiting this page, selecting the ["Battery Station" network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/0xb90cd3a37b4793c6494b78962986f4f6ed3ec2eda91a6b84fd8457d24f606b9c) and searching for your node's name (search can be started by simply typing while on the telemetry page).

## Accessing the user interface

You can access the beta application at: [https://beta.zeitgeist.pm](https://beta.zeitgeist.pm). Note that to gain access to the beta application, an NFT from one of the Zeitgeist Tarot collections is required.

You can follow our [beta app tutorial](https://whisker17.github.io/APP-Guide/#/en/app-en) to learn how to interact with it.

You can also access the polkadot.js-based (advanced) UI at: [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://bsr.zeitgeist.pm](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://bsr.zeitgeist.pm)

See [Zeitgeist Beta](./zeitgeist-beta) for details.

## Faucet

We operate a faucet, that can be used to receive the native Zeitgeist currency for the Battery Station testnet, ZBS (Zeitgeist Battery Station), which is required for numerous interactions with Battery Station. You will need an account to retrieve ZBS.

There are numerous ways to generate an account, we suggest to use [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) though, because it is simple and straightforward to use. You can get it at:

- [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)
- [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)
