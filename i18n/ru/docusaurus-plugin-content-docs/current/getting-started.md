Zeitgeist is an evolving blockchain for prediction markets and futarchy. The core functions of the Zeitgeist network include methods for creating, betting on, and resolving [prediction markets][]. However, it also consists of a [governance protocol][] which sways the direction of the network, a [decentralized court][] to handle disputes, and utilities for operating [futarchic organizations][].
