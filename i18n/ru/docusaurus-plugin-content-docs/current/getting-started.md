Zeitgeist is an evolving blockchain for prediction markets and futarchy. The
core functions of the Zeitgeist network include methods for creating, betting
on, and resolving [prediction markets][]. However, it also consists of a
[governance protocol][] which sways the direction of the network, a
[decentralized court][] to handle disputes, and utilities for operating
[futarchic organizations][].

Zeitgeist focuses on being the most advanced and usable decentralized prediction
market platform out there, all while implementing the most advanced protocol
technology.
