# Redeem

In the concept of the prediction market, the outcome token we purchased will
eventually be settled into the original token, which is ZBS in our system, but
this process is not automatic and requires us to redeem it manually.

1. When the market status is `Resolved`, we can redeem our tokens

   the right

The red box in the lower right corner indicates the number of winning tokens you
have, that is, the number of ZBS you can redeem

4. Sign the transaction and redeem your ZBS
