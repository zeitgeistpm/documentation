我们将分三部分介绍BetaNet APP。

First of all, there is a directory column on the far left. You can view the current market, create a market that you are interested in, view your own account, and view the market’s liquidity pool.

The upper right corner shows your account information, including account address and balance. It should be noted here that the address displays in Zeitgeist prefix, and the balance is ZBS which is the token of our testnet.

You can choose the topic you are interested in in the existing market to make predictions. For example, here is a topic "Whether Evergrande will declare bankruptcy by November 1st". You can make predictions based on your own information collection and choose `Yes`(EGRBYES) or `No`(EGRBNO), after clicking purchase, the transaction information will pop up on the right side:

Enter the quantity you want to buy. The upper right corner is the current price of the result. After entering the purchased quantity, the lower right corner will display the amount of ZBS that needs to be consumed. It should be noted that you should reserve a small part as a transaction fee, and then complete the transaction:
