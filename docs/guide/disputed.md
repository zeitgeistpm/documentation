# Dispute

When a market ends the Reported stage, there will be a 24h dispute period. At
this stage, if you disagree with the results reported by Oracle, you can dispute
it through `Dispute Outcome`.

You can choose the result you think is correct in the upper right corner, and
dispute a certain amount of ZBS by deposit. If the dispute is successful, Oracle
will be slashed.
