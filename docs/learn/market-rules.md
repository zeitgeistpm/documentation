# Market Creation and Permitted Markets

There are **two kinds of markets**. And **two kinds of market refusals**

- **Advised markets** require a **200 ZTG bond** and have to be **approved by
  the** [Advisory Committee](governance#advisory-committee) and can be rejected
  (with the loss of the bond)
  - Here we reject markets which are **poorly defined**
  - We lay out our rules below, but our rule of thumb is " **if it has any
    chance of confusing people or resolving ambiguously, we will not approve
    it** "
- Permissionless markets are created **without approval** and cost a **1000 ZTG
  bond**
  - Here we will **retroactively remove** markets which we **expect to cause
    significantly more harm than benefit** or which **flippantly discuss awful
    outcomes**
  - We will **never remove markets lightly**
  - We **will not remove poorly defined permissionless markets**, but **you will
    probably lose money on them**, so it's a bad idea

In future we would like to move towards most markets being permissionless, since
this allows users more freedom and requires less time from the Advisory
Committee. We will need to build a process to support users here.

## Approved markets

We're is currently building an optional **off-chain pre-approval process** for
users to work together to create high quality markets. If you're interested in
discussing an idea for a market proposal, contact us on our Discord in
[market-creation] (which uses Discord's new forum feature). Until the off-chain
process is set up, markets must be submitted directly to the Advisory Committee
using the Zeitgeist app. Beware that markets submitted without discussing with
us these are much more likely to be rejected with users losing their bonds.

The **average (median) user expects to be betting in a fair environment**. They
expect things to "**just work**" and for **markets to mean what it seems like
they mean**. While there is room for a "wild west" of experimental markets, the
Advisory Committee gives its approval to markets that users can trust without
question.

**Zeitgeist pays a high price to remove its markets**. Hence a bad market cannot
be quickly altered. If a market resolves too soon... it resolves too soon. There
are no easy take-backs on the blockchain.

We therefore reject markets that are badly written or confusing. Users will lose
their bounties.

## Markets the Advisory Committee will reject

- **Markets without clear questions**
  - e.g. "What's going to happen in Ukraine?"
    - While users might have some sense of what this market is about, it is not
      clear from the question. Users must be able to get an accurate view of
      what the market is about from just reading the question.
    - To put this another way, if more than 1% of users read the question and
      imagine the market is about something it's not about and bet on it, this
      is too many.
- **Markets without clear resolution criteria**
  - e.g. "Who will win the 2024 US Presidential election?" Resolution criterion:
    "This resolves as the winner of the election"
    - This was not good resolution criterion in 2020. Do we want the person who
      won according to AP? The person who got the most votes? The person who
      gets the most electors, even if some are "faithless electors" (this sounds
      charged, but is a technical term)?
    - We need a clear resolution source. If we want to ask a question about what
      Zeitgeist or a certain user judges, then that should be _explicit_ within
      the criteria.
  - e.g. "What will the price of ETH be at September 7, 2022, 15:30 PM?"
    - It's unclear what the time zone is.
    - It's unclear in which currency the price of ETH is measured.
    - It's unclear which source is used (there are many ETH/USD markets).
    - Do we mean Proof of Work or Proof of Stake?
- **Markets with outcomes which do not consider all major possible outcomes**
  - e.g. "Who will win UFC #290?" Outcomes: Adam Abbes, Balijis Bhat.
    - UFC fights are regularly postponed or cancelled. There needs to be a
      "fight cancelled" option. Without this, the market could resolve
      uncertainly. This will be a huge mess.
    - A good catch all here is to have an "other" option, clearly defined as not
      the options already mentioned
- **Markets which close too long before, or too long after an event has
  happened**
  - e.g. "Who will win the 2022 world cup, if that event takes place?"
    Resolution date: July 2022.
    - We have a 4 day reporting limit. Markets have to report within this time.
      So here there would be no way to resolve the market because it finished
      far too early.
  - e.g. "Who will win the 2022 world cup, if that event takes place?"
    Resolution date: 2024.
    - There is no reason for the market to stay open this long. Users might be
      confused.
- **Confusing images**
- **Wrong categories**

## Permissionless markets

Zeitgeist removes markets which on expectation cause 10x more harm than the
information/incentives they create.

The following list would seem to go without saying. But we will say them to make
our expectations clear. **By making clear bright lines, we free the community to
make infinite and interesting markets within the large space of permitted
markets**. If you create markets like this we will be upset with you. Likewise,
if we remove markets unnecessarily, you should rightly be upset with us.

### Markets we always reject

- **Explicit market titles/descriptions/images**
  - Rather than "Will that [expletive] arsehole Dave get fired?" you can write
    "Will Dave get fired?"
  - Don't add advertisements to your markets description
- **Individuals being harmed**
  - Rather than "Will [world leader] be harmed?" you can write "When will world
    leader leave office?"
- **Very specific predictions about locations or individuals suffering acts of
  terrorism**
- **Markets which cause Zeitgeist to break national laws**
  - e.g. markets which create ways for US citizens to bet.
- **We reserve the right to add to this list things which cause the same
  magnitude of harm when predicted**.
- We also reserve the right to **remove markets around the privacy of private
  individuals**. We will write more guidance as this issue becomes clearer to
  us.
- Finally, **we reserve the right to remove markets which seek to game our
  rules**. We will have a high bar for this, but should there be low liquidity
  markets which seek to go right to the edge of what is permitted, we may take
  action against those markets.

### Why do we care?

- Zeitgeist is a place where anyone can create markets. **But with personal
  freedom comes the personal freedom of others. Some markets could create harm.
  Where that harm is likely to be much larger than the benefit, we will
  consider, then remove those markets.**
- While markets predict, they also incentivise. Placing a large bet on something
  not happening is equivalent to offering a large reward for it happening and
  allowing others to signal that they are working on it. Sometimes this is a fun
  or beneficial side effect. Sometimes it is a harm to be mitigated.
- For any genuinely interesting question, it is possible to frame markets in a
  way that doesn't have these bad outcomes. If there isn't, then it's not a
  market that is good to make.
- Zeitgeist is allows far more freedom of action here than other prediction
  markets. If you wish to discuss this, please have an example of a specific
  market you wish to create. Responding to queries here is a lower priority than
  creating interesting markets and building new technology.
