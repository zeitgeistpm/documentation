### Advisory Committee

The _Advisory Committee_ ensures the quality of markets on the Zeitgeist platform. 
It is allowed to make the following decisions:

- Force changes to on-chain identities (requires two-thirds approval)
- Approve advised markets (requires single member approval)
- Reject advised markets if they are deemed valid (requires majority approval)
- Close markets (requires two-thirds approval) or destroy markets (requires full
  approval) which are in gross violation of our rules of conduct

The rules that the Advisory Committee enforces may be found in
[Rules for Market Creation](market-rules.md).
