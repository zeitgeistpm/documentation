As you can see, if you need to add liquidity into a market, you need to have all
the outcome tokens in the market, and there is also a certain amount of ZBS

3. When buying in the market, we provide a one-click shortcut to purchase all
   the outcome tokens. The specific operations are as follows:

   1. Select a market of interest and click on the red box
