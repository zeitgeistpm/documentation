## APP Introduction

We will introduce BetaNet APP in three parts.

First of all, there is a directory column on the far left. You can view the
current market, create a market that you are interested in, view your own
account, and view the market’s liquidity pool.

The upper right corner shows your account information, including account address
and balance. It should be noted here that the address displays in Zeitgeist
prefix, and the balance is ZBS which is the token of our testnet.

### Get Testnet Token

You can choose the topic you are interested in in the existing market to make
predictions. For example, here is a topic "Whether Evergrande will declare
bankruptcy by November 1st". You can make predictions based on your own
information collection and choose `Yes`(EGRBYES) or `No`(EGRBNO), after clicking
purchase, the transaction information will pop up on the right side:

Enter the quantity you want to buy. The upper right corner is the current price
of the result. After entering the purchased quantity, the lower right corner
will display the amount of ZBS that needs to be consumed. It should be noted
that you should reserve a small part as a transaction fee, and then complete the
transaction:

### Arbitrage

After the purchase is successful, you can check your position in
`My Account`-`My Portfolio`, and you can also make arbitrage by selling high and
buying low.
